- **Professional Self-Assessment** âš«

My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has played a crucial role in shaping my professional aspirations and core values. It has equipped me with the skills needed to become a valuable asset to future employers. This ePortfolio highlights my capability to design and develop code and software programs that meet industry standards. While it doesnâ€™t capture the full extent of my work throughout the program, it provides a solid representation of my knowledge in three key areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

**Program Reflection**

One of the classes that made a lasting impression was CS-260, which focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. I've always enjoyed writing algorithms, and this course significantly deepened my understanding of both data structures and algorithms. I came to realize how fundamental these concepts are to programming; without them, programs would be nearly impossible to build, maintain, or debug. Data structures help organize and manage data efficiently, eliminating unnecessary and repetitive code, which is crucial for even the simplest software development tasks.

Algorithms are equally vital, as they streamline processes, reduce redundancy, and enhance program functionality. Their potential is vast, with many powerful algorithms yet to be discovered. This course provided me with essential tools that have advanced my ability to create any program I set my mind to.

Another class that proved invaluable was CS-310, the Collaboration and Group Project course. Before this class, I had little knowledge of version control, particularly Git. It took some time to grasp, but the course taught me the importance of version control, especially in collaborative environments. Version control allows a project to be stored in a centralized location, enabling team members to access the latest version and merge their work seamlessly. This prevents the confusion of having multiple versions of the project across different computers.

One of the most useful aspects of version control is the ability to maintain a detailed history and changelog, allowing the project to be reverted to a previous version if needed. This is particularly handy when new features donâ€™t work as intended or need to be removed. The class helped me refine my Git skills by requiring me to upload all my projects to GitHub, reminding me of the convenience and efficiency of using such a platform.

While I've highlighted these two courses, I gained invaluable knowledge from each class. I was introduced to Python in CS-200, learned about Scrum in CS-250, and discovered the importance of testing in CS-310. My studies also included Discrete Math, Statistics, Calculus, Physics, Linear Algebra, databases, data analysis, computational graphics, and design. I gained experience with Python, C++, Java, and much more. I deeply appreciate all the skills Iâ€™ve acquired at SNHU, and I look forward to applying them throughout my future career.

**Final Project Summary**

For the software design and engineering portion of my project, I chose to apply what I learned in my programming courses by developing a simple auto shop service selection application using Python. In my classes, I gained a solid understanding of basic programming concepts, and I decided to apply them to create an interactive console-based application.

Rather than using a simple script or predefined framework, I opted to create a custom solution that incorporates user input, dictionary data structures, and class-based design. This allowed me to build a program that simulates a real-world scenario where a user can select services from an auto shop, view the prices, and calculate the total cost.

To accomplish this, I utilized the skills I learned throughout my coursework, particularly in data structures and object-oriented programming. I also researched additional methods to improve user interaction, such as resizing the terminal for better display and incorporating ASCII art to enhance the user experience. This portion demonstrates my skills in software design and engineering by expanding the functionality and user engagement of a simple console application. It also highlights my ability to apply Python programming in a practical scenario, showcasing my understanding of class-based design, user input handling, and real-time data processing.

For the algorithms and data structures portion of my project, I focused on enhancing the efficiency and organization of a service selection application that I developed. Originally, this application was simpler, but I applied the skills I learned in my Data Structures and Algorithms (CS-260) course to make it more advanced and efficient.

I restructured the project by incorporating a dictionary to store the available services and their corresponding prices. This use of a dictionary, a key data structure in Python, allowed me to efficiently manage and retrieve service information based on user input. The dictionary provided a way to eliminate redundant code and streamlined the process of mapping services to their prices.

Additionally, I employed control structures and exception handling to manage user inputs more effectively. By implementing these algorithms, the program can now handle invalid inputs gracefully and prompt the user to select a valid service. This not only makes the program more robust but also improves the overall user experience.

This portion of the project demonstrates my proficiency with algorithms and data structures, particularly in organizing data and handling user interactions efficiently. It also showcases my ability to apply Python to solve real-world problems, enhancing the complexity and usability of the application.

For the databases portion of my final project, I chose to build upon my earlier work from DAD 220, where I initially created a MySQL database to manage customer orders and their details. For the enhancement, I decided to transition to using MongoDB Atlas, incorporating what I learned in CS-340 to create a more robust and scalable database solution.

I began by deploying a new database in MongoDB Atlas named "SNHU" and integrated it with a simple application. This transition from a structured SQL-based system to a NoSQL environment allowed me to explore different aspects of database management, such as user authentication and network access setup. I also utilized MongoDBâ€™s shell and graphical interface to manage data, which provided a more intuitive and flexible way to handle complex datasets.

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to adapt and apply database management skills across different platforms. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas, I was able to create a database that not only retains the core functionalities of my original artifact but also adds new features like user roles and data visualization capabilities. This project showcases my understanding of databases and my ability to apply that knowledge in a cloud-based environment, ensuring the database is secure, scalable, and ready for production use.
